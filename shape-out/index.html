            <span>What is Firefox Nightly?</span>
            <br> Every day, Mozilla developers write code that is merged into a common code repository (mozilla-central) and
            every day that code is compiled so as to create a pre-release version of Firefox based on this code for testing
            purposes, this is what we call a Nightly build. Once this code matures, it is merged into stabilization repositories
            (Beta and Dev Edition) where that code will be polished until we reach a level of quality that allows us to ship
            a new final version of Firefox to hundreds of millions of people. This development process used to ship a new
            version of Firefox every 5 to 8 weeks is called the Train Model.
            <br>
            <span>Should I become a Nightly user?</span>
            <br> Of course, Nightly does not have the polish, quality and stability of the Release channel as this is a work
            in progress but we are doing our best through automation, QA and community to provide you the best nightly builds
            possible. If you are a power-user, that you want to have access to features in developments months before they
            become mainstream, have tolerance for occasional functional regressions and are looking for an easy way to help
            Mozilla and Firefox development, you should use Nightly (ideally as your main browser but you can also use it
            alongside Firefox on the release channel or another browser). Unlike Firefox on the Release channel, Nightly
            sends by default anonymized usage statistics, called Telemetry which helps us improve Firefox and track regressions
            on a daily basis. Just using Nightly and sending telemetry data is already of great help to all Mozilla developers
            as it allows them to get usage statistics on the features they work on. Of course, Nightly may be more likely
            to crash than a final release and sending your crashes to our engineers is also of considerable help as it helps
            us catch instabilities and identify issues long before end-users are exposed to them. And if you want to go a
            step further, you can file bugs in our Bug tracker with detailed information about what is not working for you
            in Nightly.
